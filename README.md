# greedyGame
A game concept adapted from one of the game show I've watched. 

Main Idea is that in a 3 x 3 grid, there're 4 players (A, B, C, D).
Each player are positioned in a way that they can select either 1 of the 3 values (in front, left and right).

Goal of the game is to avoid choosing the same value as the other players.
Values that are chosen more than once are not counted.
If no other player pciked the value you chose, the value gets added to your score.
